Project: Lending-Club Dataset Exploration


## Project Overview
This project explores the Lending Club loan dataset, focusing on data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. It answers various questions related to loan issuance, default rates, and predictive modeling.

### Motivation
The Lending Club dataset is a valuable resource for understanding the dynamics of peer-to-peer lending and credit risk. This project aims to gain insights into the lending landscape and develop predictive models to assess loan default risk.

### Key Objectives
1. Analyze loan issuance trends over time.
2. Assess the default rates for different loan categories.
3. Build and evaluate predictive models for loan default.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis
Question 1: How many loans did Lending Club issue each month from January 2016 to June 2019? What percentage of loans issued in each of these months defaulted?
Question 2: What are the top five loan categories during 2016, 2017, and 2018? What is the default rate for each of these loan categories for each year?
Linear Regression Model
We extend the linear regression-based default model using variables like FICO score and debt-to-income ratio. Performance differences in terms of model R-squared are explored.

##### Visual Summaries
We create visual summaries of the Lending Club loan data, including histograms, time series plots, and other relevant visualizations.

###### Binary Classification Models
We explore various binary classification models using scikit-learn. Model performance is compared using ROC curves and precision/recall curves.
